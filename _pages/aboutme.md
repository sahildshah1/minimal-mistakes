## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist at Civis Analytics. Prior to working at Civis Analytics, I completed a
PhD in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/applied-math/) and 
[Braun Computational Biology Lab](https://sites.northwestern.edu/braunlab/biocomplexity/) 
at Northwestern University. The focus of my research was on developing statistical 
methods to find disease associated genes biological data. 

During my PhD program, I interned as a data scientist at Tempus, a technology
company that organizes and analyzes biomedical data to personalize cancer
treatment. I was also the co-chair of the McCormick Graduate Leadership Council,
the engineering school's graduate student council which promotes community
amongst its students. I received a BS *magna cum laude* from Columbia University 
and a MS from Northwestern University.
