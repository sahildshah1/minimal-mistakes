## About Me

I'm a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/applied-math/) and 
[Braun Computational Biology Lab](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=23119) at Northwestern University. The focus of my research
is on developing statistical methods to find genes and mechanisms
that  contribute to disease from biological data. My interests
include statistics, machine learning, data analysis, programming in R and
Python, and scientific communication.

During my PhD program, I interned as a data scientist at Tempus, a technology
company that organizes and analyzes biomedical data to personalize cancer
treatment. I was also the co-chair of the McCormick Graduate Leadership Council,
the engineering school's graduate student council which promotes community
amongst its students. I received a BS *magna cum laude* from Columbia University 
and an MS from Northwestern University. 

I enjoy working in teams to solve problems and am currently looking for data
science opportunities. I'm willing to relocate. For my resume, [see here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WWj_LvMzB10UcnrSLu18wp4klXY34CG5/view?usp=sharing)
