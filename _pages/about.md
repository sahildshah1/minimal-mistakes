Hi! I'm Sahil. Welcome to my website. I'm an applied math PhD student at Northwestern 
University in Chicago and have been working in a computational biology lab for 
the past four years. I'm looking for data science opportunities preferably in
the Northeast, but I'm willing to relocate anywhere for the right opportunity. 

My research projects at Northwestern have been driven by the automation of 
biological experiments. These technologies have made it possible to probe complex
diseases and identify genes for precision medicine, but yield large datasets
that require advanced algorithms to extract useful information. 


- Piece together a description of applied math , what I did and why 

I'm working toward a PhD in applied mathematics at Northwestern University. I've undertaken my graduate work in a computational systems biology lab and work on projects to devise and apply algorithms that identify disease associated genes from high-throughput biological data. This summer I was a Data Science Intern at Tempus in Chicago. I'm interested on working in data science after I graduate from Northwestern.

- Piece together into a descripton of what I do and add in tools I use from my resume

New technologies have made it possible to probe complex diseases and identify
genes for precision medicine. These technologies yield large datasets that
require advanced algorithms to extract useful information. 

Since genes interact
with one another, we seek specific genes that have an effect on the whole
system. 

The ability to profile the expression levels of thousands of genes
simultaneously and identify the genes associated with a disease has opened new
avenues in  understanding disease mechanisms and developing precision medicine
interventions. 

Since the organization of physical and functional cellular
networks into databases,  it has been possible to develop methods that analyze
expression data in the context of these networks. A key challenge is to combine
the expression data with the systems-level information and still obtain specific
molecular  targets. 

These methods can open up new
avenues of precision medicine by identifying disease-associated genes.

- What I'm doing and how I'm doing it 

The tools might be different but taking apart 


- Write a description of what I do in my free time like at the end of professional
introdutions online ? 

In my free time I love to read and am currently  reading  Karl Ove Knausgaard's 
six volume series.
