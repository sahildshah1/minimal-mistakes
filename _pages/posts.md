<!-- Write a pargraph description of the idea based on 

In our previous study, we presented a new analysis technique, NIDG, that
identifies driver genes by finding genes with localized differential expression
on a global gene network. We can't however evaluate the sensitivity and
specificity of our current approach or identify driver genes that have a
different signature on the gene network (e.g. differentially expressed paths vs
localized differential expression) because we did not have a labeled training
set of driver genes.



Our new analysis technique, NIDG, integrates systems-level information with gene
expression data and therefore takes in as input an independent model of cellular
interactions. The network model that we use, KEGG, and our treatment of it
however neglects features of the underlying biological processes that may affect
the performance of our algorithm. Most pathway databases (including KEGG) are
not phenotype-specific and we therefore have to assume that the network doesn't
change between conditions. Furthermore, our algorithm calculates geodesic
distances between genes, but does not take into account the direction or type of
interaction or the global structure of the network. -->
