Hi! I'm Sahil. Welcome to my website. I'm an applied math PhD student at
Northwestern  University in Chicago and have been working in a computational
biology lab for  the past four years. I'm looking for data science opportunities
preferably in the Northeast, but I'm willing to relocate anywhere for the right
opportunity!

My research projects at Northwestern have been driven by the automation of
biological experiments. These technologies have made it possible to probe
complex diseases and identify genes for precision medicine, but  they yield
large datasets that require advanced analysis techniques to extract useful
information. My projects have focused on developing computational methods to
identify the specific genes that affect disrupted biological systems so that
that can be targeted therapeutically.

On the weekends, I tutor returning students at Northwestern's School of
Professional Studies and catch up on the latest novel that I'm reading
(currently Book 2: A Man in Love by by Karl Ove Knausgaard).
