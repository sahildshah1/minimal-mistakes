title: "Were all the NBA teams 0.500 against the spread?"

## Introduction 

With the [legalization of sports betting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html), my friends
and I have been talking a lot of gambling. 

One question that came up was whether all the NBA teams were 0.500 against the spread.
In theory, lines should be set so that they *are* 0.500 against the spared and 
a site would make money off of their take. 


## Data and Exploratory Analysis

Boston over-performed relative to expectations and GSW under-performed relative
to expectations.  


## Discussion 

Cavs and Warriors underperformed. Do the lines get inflated because of the 
super-stars on the team? Do Lebron's team's over the past 5 year's have a similar
trend vs the spread? Do you get backdoor covers when they bench their starters?

If you bet the Warriors all year you would make money? Individual games?

## Methods

I scrubbed and visualized the data using Python and learned:
