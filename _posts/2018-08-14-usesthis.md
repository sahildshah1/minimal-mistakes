title: "Hardware and software recommendations"

Here are the tools I use to get work down. For more recommendations from
other people, check out the [uses this blog](https://usesthis.com/)  
 

## What hardware do I use? 

I use a 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro (with 16 GB of RAM and a Retina display) that
I plug into a 24 inch Dell external monitor when I'm at my desk. When
I have to run any computationally intensive jobs I use Northwestern's [computing
cluster](https://sahildshah1.github.io/wikiQuest/). On the go, I use an iPhone 7.

<!-- My lab has generously provided a 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro with 16 GB of RAM and
a Retina display for me to use.  When I'm at my desk, I plug into an 24 inch
Dell external monitor and arrange the displays so they're stacked on top of each
other. I run any computationally intensive jobs on. I've been an iPhone user
since college, briefly used an Android phone but then  mostly due to peer
pressure switched back to my current iPhone 7. -->

## What software do I use?

On my Mac, f.lux is a must-have and I use LaunchBar instead of Spotlight and
Google Chrome instead of Safari. I have Microsoft Office installed, but  make
presentations with Google Slides and write documents in LaTeX. My favorite reference manager is Paperpile. 

For developing code or working with text files, I use iTerm2 (the 'Hot Key
Window' is it's killer feature), Sublime Text 2 (with the Git Gutter package and
Vintage Mode turned ON), git, and Jupyter notebooks (for exploratory analyses).

<!-- git is essential for tracking and collaborating on all of these text files. I
don't know  what I did before Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analyses. My 
favorite reference manager is Paperpile.  -->

On my iPhone 7, my favorite apps include: WhatsApp, Spotify, Overcast, the NY Times, Dark Sky, and Transit.
