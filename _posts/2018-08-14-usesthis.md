title: "Hardware and software that I use"

## Introduction 


## What hardware do I use? 

My lab has graciously provided a 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro and a Dell external
monitor. When I have to run computationally intensive jobs, I use Northwestern's
HPCC Quest. I briefly  used an Android phone but a combination of 
peer pressure and usability led me to switch back to an iPhone 7. 

## What software do I use?

On my Mac, f.lux is a must-have and I use LaunchBar instead of Spotlight. I
have Microsfot Office installed, but 
make presentations with Google Slides and write documents in LaTeX. 

I live in Google Chrome (with the LastPass and Paperpile extensions installed) and iTerm2
(the 'Hot Key Window' is it's killer feature). 

Sublime Text 2 (with the Git Gutter package and Vintage Mode turned ON) is my 
text editor of choice (NB: https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/vintage-mode-not-working/4807/5). I use it to write R or Python functions, LaTeX files, Markdown
files etc. git is essential for tracking and collaborating on all of these text files. I don't know 
what I did before Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analyses. 

I've eschewed any kind of calendar or task manager software for my personal work
and have found that a 
physical planner works best for me. 

On my iPhone, my favorite apps include: WhatsApp, LastPass, Spotify,
Overcast, the NY Times, Dark Sky, and Transit.
