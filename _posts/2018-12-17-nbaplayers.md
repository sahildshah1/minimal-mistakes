title: "How many different kinds of NBA players are there?"

## Introduction: NBA players 


<!-- For the 2017-2017 season, groups could be different or a player might play a 
different role in another year -->


## Results: How many different kinds of NBA players are there?

With [data](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2018_per_game.html) 
on 469 NBA players 2017-2017 per game stats, we can interrogate the number of 
differt kinds of NBA players. The **Python code I wrote to pull, scrub, and 
analyze the data is available** on Github as a [Jupyter notebook](

)

<!-- 
on the on 
the win-loss records against the spread for the 2017-2018 NBA season, 
we can calculate how far each team was from 0.500 win record against
the spread and investigate the variation in this data. The **Python code I wrote
to pull, scrub and analyze the data is available** on GitHub as a 
[Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sahildshah1/funData-playground/blob/master/deliverables/nba-spreads.ipynb#)


Function they tend to play on their team in 2017-2017  -->


- Group A: Play makers

- Group B: Shot takers

<!-- Shot takers tend to drive or pull up to shoot (e.g. Anthony Davis and Emidd
pull up). 
 -->

- Group C: Role players


<!-- Play less minutes 

What's the break down of groups for Warrios teams, Cavs, All Star teams?

## Methods: Notes on using K-Means and Python to perform this analysis 

<!-- K Means function arguments

K means algorithm and Lloyd's algorithm?

K means number of clusters
- Elbow method: 
- Silhoutte:
