title: "PhD project: Comparing gene-network analysis tools" 
---


One of my PhD projects involved evaluating and discussing 'network-based pathway
analysis techniques', algorithms which find disease associated mechanisms by 
taking into account the network of interactions between genes and their products.
This project was joint work with [Dr. Rosemary Braun.](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=23119)

We presented a [poster of our work at the Chicago Area SIAM Student Conferencee](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwwWdkWAoHm0aWkyMHlnS09WckU/view?usp=sharing) and 
the work is currently [available on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1993).


## Scientific summary: Network Methods for Pathway Analysis of Genomic Data

Rapid advances in high-throughput technologies have led to considerable interest
in analyzing genome-scale data in the context of biological pathways, with the
goal of identifying functional systems that are involved in a given phenotype.
In the most common approaches, biological pathways are modeled as simple sets of
genes, neglecting the network of interactions comprising the pathway and
treating all genes as equally important to the pathway's function. Recently, a
number of new methods have been proposed to integrate pathway topology in the
analyses, harnessing existing knowledge and enabling more nuanced models of
complex biological systems. However, there is little guidance available to
researches choosing between these methods.

In this review, we discuss eight topology-based methods, comparing their
methodological approaches and appropriate use cases. In addition, we present the
results of the application of these methods to a curated set of ten gene
expression profiling studies using a common set of pathway annotations. We
report the computational efficiency of the methods and the consistency of the
results across methods and studies to help guide users in choosing a method. We
also discuss the challenges and future outlook for improved network analysis
methodologies.
